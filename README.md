Identification of the plant diseases is the key to prohibiting the losses in the production and amount of the agricultural product. The studies of the plant diseases mean the studies of   patterns seen on the plant leaves. Health monitoring and disease detection on plant is very crucial for agriculture. Monitoring Disease manually is not feasible for the farmer. It requires large amount of work, time, expertise in the plant diseases, and also requires more time. Therefore, processing of image is done based on patterns which are visible on leaves  for the detection of plant diseases. Disease detection involves the steps like image acquisition, pre-processing, segmentation, classification. This Project is a website which will predict the disease in fraction of seconds. This Website detect Plant disease by processing the image of Leaf using ML.
